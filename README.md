# INFR3335U-F2021-FinalExam

Using the template, I have created my exam project for INFR 3335U, Social and Multiplayer Game Design.

Most of the code I used for this project is based off tutorials we did throughout the semester. I used the ILE-4/5 project as a guide to create a proper working menu scene, loading scene, lobby scene (with a room and create/join panel) and multiplayer arena scene. I gave the player the ability to spawn on either side of the islands in the middle based on a random number.

I did not use any outside assets beyond Unity's provided UI elements (text, buttons, etc), the template given and code we discussed and learn in class.
